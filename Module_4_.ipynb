        "Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. While `pandas.read_html()` is convenient for tables, many websites don't structure their data in simple tables, or you might need to extract information from other parts of the page (like text, links, images, etc.).\n",
        "### I. Understanding Web Scraping\n",
        "\n",
        "Web scraping involves:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Fetching (Downloading) Web Pages:** Sending HTTP requests to a web server to retrieve the HTML content of a page.\n",
        "2.  **Parsing HTML/XML:** Analyzing the fetched content to locate and extract the specific data points of interest.\n",
        "3.  **Storing Data:** Saving the extracted data in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON, database).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Important Considerations before Scraping:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Legality and Ethics:** Always check a website's `robots.txt` file (e.g., `www.example.com/robots.txt`) to understand their scraping policies. Respect `Disallow` rules. Be mindful of terms of service and copyright.\n",
        "  * **Rate Limiting:** Avoid overwhelming servers with too many requests in a short period. Implement delays between requests.\n",
        "  * **Dynamic Content:** Websites that load content via JavaScript (e.g., with frameworks like React, Angular, Vue) can be challenging for `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` alone. For such cases, tools like Selenium or Playwright, which can control a web browser, might be necessary.\n",
        "  * **Website Structure Changes:** Websites frequently update their layouts, which can break your scraping scripts. Your scripts may require regular maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### II. `requests`: Fetching Web Pages\n",
        "\n",
        "The `requests` library is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, allowing you to send various types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). For web scraping, we primarily use `GET` requests to retrieve page content.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Installation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "pip install requests\n",
        "```\n",

        "      * `tag_name`: e.g., `'div'`, `'a'`, `'span'`.\n",
        "      * `attributes`: A dictionary, e.g., `{'class': 'my_class'}`, `{'id': 'my_id'}`. Note `class_` because `class` is a Python keyword.\n",
        "  * **`soup.find_all(tag_name, attributes)`**: Returns a *list* of all matching HTML tags.\n",
        "  * **`.text`**: Extracts the text content of a tag (strips out HTML tags).\n",
        "  * **`.get('attribute_name')` or `['attribute_name']`**: Extracts the value of an attribute (e.g., `href` for links, `src` for images).\n",
        "  * **`.strip()`**: Removes leading/trailing whitespace from strings.\n",
        "  * **`.prettify()`**: Formats the HTML for better readability (useful for debugging).\n",
        "  * **Navigation methods:**\n",
        "      * `tag.parent`: The immediate parent tag.\n",
        "      * `tag.children`: A generator for the direct children of a tag.\n",
        "      * `tag.find_next_sibling()`, `tag.find_previous_sibling()`: Find adjacent tags at the same level.\n",
        "      * `tag.find_parent()`: Finds an ancestor tag.\n",

        "### IV. Practical Considerations & Next Steps\n",
